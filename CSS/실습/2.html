  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>CSS is constantly coming out with new versions. CSS 1, introduced in 1996, became the basis for CSS. CSS 2.1 is the
    standard for CSS, and new features and tools have been added compared to previous versions. Most web browsers
    support
    CSS 3 well. Currently, the W3C is making CSS 3 a standard.</p>

  <p>CSS has several levels and profiles. Each level of CSS usually contains new features and is divided into CSS1,
    CSS2,
    CSS3, and CSS4. Profiles are a subset of CSS, usually one or more levels, created for a particular device or user
    interface. Currently there are profiles for portable devices, printers and television sets.</p>
